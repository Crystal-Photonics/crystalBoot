-The simplest way to build gmock is via qtcreator. Just open the cmake project as project and build it.

if you see :
[ FATAL ] [..]crystalTestFrameworkApp/libs/gmock-1.7.0/gtest/include/gtest/internal/gtest-port.h:1340:: pthread_mutex_lock(&mutex_)failed with error 22
then use cmake with -Dgtest_disable_pthreads=ON. Then you have to compile gmock again completly. This error should now be solved.

if using without qtcreator:
-windows and pthread work different than normal posix. you should disable pthread under cmake if the error "'nanosleep' was not declared in this scope" appears.
